Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player is asked to choose a category (countries,things,etc) and based on the chosen category the players has to guess the word by speculating one letter at a time. If the player gives 8 wrong guesses then he/she loses the game. For building this game we have used  random and time modules. Also we have using tkinter for creating GUI (Graphic User Interface).
